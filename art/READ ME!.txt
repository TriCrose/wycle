This is not everything, I'm taking a break now. Remainder to come this weekend!

Images in the 'reference' folder are icons+backgrounds that allow 
you to see what the picture should look like inside the app.

Please use the images inside the 'use_tese' folder, and be careful 
to enable transparency.

I'll provide rectangular versions later, I need to know what dimensions
they should have first.
